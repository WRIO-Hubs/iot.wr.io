    "On June 24, 2010, Michael Stevens launched the main Vsauce channel. Initially, the channel's programming focused on video games and featured a number of different hosts. However, certain segments such as \"IMG!\" slowly took over and Michael Stevens became the sole host. The channel then graduated to a mix of information and online activities, and solely educational segments popped up. The educational segments became more popular, and since September 9, 2012, only the educational segment (known as DOT) has been presented. According to episode #18 of \"LÃœT\" on the original Vsauce channel, the name \"Vsauce\" was generated using the fake website generator portion of a site called Fake Name Generator. After Stevens generated the fake website \"Vsauce.com\" he registered it and began uploading videos. In December 2010, the Vsauce2 (on December 7), and Vsauce3 (on December 24) channels were opened. On July 25, 2012, the WeSauce channel was opened. Vsauce was one of the fastest growing channels during September 2012. During that month, the main Vsauce channel reached 1 million subscribers. In the same month, Bill Nye appeared in one of the main channel's videos, which focused on the joke, \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"The former logo, based on Guinta's designs.Stevens details in the video A Defense of Comic Sans that the text font Alsina was used by the Vsauce channels because of the close resemblance it has to the handwriting of Nik Guinta, the creator of the original Vsauce logo. A new branding scheme designed by Natasha Jen was adopted in December 2014 in order to bring a new, 'grown-up' feel to the channels. It utilizes the Din Next Rounded font as well as fluid designs in order to convey the idea of sauce that the name \"Vsauce\" implies.",
