    "Prior to meeting their guests my NY friends together with children manually fill in the Welcome card with a personal message and an invitation to examine the content of the box and to color the cards.Guests point out that the bundle does attract their attention and they spend a considerable amount of time examining it. And children gladly color the sights cards that parents later often take with them as a souvenir (see below). Guests are happy their children have something to do while they are making necessary arrangements and having rest after the trip.It shall be noted that apart from leasing apartments my friends provide additional services, and thus I prepared a Card Box for:* Services: food delivery, city tours with photo sessions, bike sharing, airport shuttle and etc.* Events: that upon the guests’ request they go together to* Places: based on an agreement with local businesses the guests receive a discount at local bars and restaurants after they show a corresponding card",

    "However, the most valuable for the guests is information about local restaurants, interesting locations and useful services like bikes sharing and photo tours. Thanks to my friends I’m already receiving offers from local businesses and events sponsors. For every city there’ll be a possibility to acquire ready-made sets of cards, or to print them out individually. This is especially true for those who, just like my friends, want to make tours for their guests and stamp “I was here” with a date on the cards of sights or events they visited (often already colored by children, as described above). Guests gladly take such cards with them as souvenirs.",
    "Colored card\n",
    "No doubt, all the required information about any city can be found in the Internet. However, it is not often that guests will look for something with a goal in mind, while in case with the cards they will run into interesting offers just looking through them out of curiosity. Besides, if specialized websites function as a global database containing information about everything, then cards provide a personalized approach where the entire range of services turn around the guest. The appropriate locations are selected by the apartment owner, who knows best places to visit in the vicinity, especially that many objects are within an easy reach: useful stores with everything a traveler may need after the arrival; small fancy places that are difficult to find in the Internet but worth visiting; small restaurants with good inexpensive meals; and etc. All this provides a unique local experience for guests who enjoy taking advantage of the owner’s advice and recommendations in the form of cards."
